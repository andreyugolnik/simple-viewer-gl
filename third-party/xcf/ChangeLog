	* Version 1.0.7
	* Fix GPL-to-PD transition: missed copyrigh blurb in online banner.

2009-07-03  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Version 1.0.6
	* Change licensing from GPL-2 to PD.
	* Fix bug: A layer without an alpha channel bug with an active
	  layer mask was wrongly considered to obscure all lower layers.
	* Fix bug: xcf2pnm would guess PBM as the output format even if
	  the background was explicitly set to an intermediate gray, or
	  if -T might produce grays.

	* Version 1.0.5
	* Fix various bugs if extracted part of image contains pixels with
	  negative canvas-based coordinates. Thanks to J\"orgen Grahn for
	  reporting these. (Debian bug #533361).
	* One of the fixed bugs was a buffer overrun which would allow a
	  remote attacker to execute arbitrary if he could trick a user
	  into converting an appropriately crafted XCF file with either
	  the -C or the -O option. CVE-2009-2175.
	* Fix another bug with interpretation of -C flag, which would
	  convert the *intersection* of the visible layers rather than
	  their *union*, as intended. Did I ever test this stuff?
	* Minor manpage fixes; -C description should be less confusing now.
	* Apply patch from Marcus Alanen for easier RPM packaging:
	  $(DESTDIR) honored in Makefile's install target, spec file added.

2006-05-14  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Version 1.0.4
	* Work around bug in certain older Gimp releases that would
	  save the wrong length word of a Colormap property.

2006-04-17  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Version 1.0.3
	* Also look for color name database in other locations than
	  /usr/lib/X11, in an attempty to be X11R7 friendly

2006-02-22  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Version 1.0.2
	* Don't ship aclocal.m4 in tarball; it will be re-assembled
	  whenever needed anyway.
	* Add option -C to autocrop to visible layers, suggested
	  by Anthony DeRobertis (Debian bug #353883).
	* Change metavariable for -Z option argument from "cmd"
	  to "command", following suggestion by Anthony DeRobertis
	  (Debian bug #353872).

2006-02-20  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Version 1.0.1
	* Make sure that -b with an unknown color actually leads to
	  a fatal error when the X11 color name database is not found.

	* Version 1.0
	* xcfview added
	* Support for translated manpages added

2006-02-13  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Version 0.9.1
	* Experimental l10n support added

2006-02-12  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Version 0.9
	* Add layer mode Color. Now all of the Gimp's layer modes are
	  supported. :-)
	* Revamp the test suite inputs once again (they did not cover all
	  combinations of colored pixels vs fully white or blacK).
	
	* Version 0.8.1
	* Add layer modes Hue, Value, Saturation and tests for same.

2006-02-11  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Version 0.8
	* Add tests of various error diagnostics to the test suite
	* Revamp some of the test suite inputs such that HSV space
	  layer modes can be tested with the same files.

	* Version 0.7.2
	* Do not precompute the big multiplication table by default,
	  it is quick enough to do it at run-time as needed (which
	  lets the binaries shrink significantly).

2006-02-07  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Respect -A option when generating indexed PNG (that is,
	  create a tRNS chunk even if it's trivial); add test of
	  -A in xcf2png to the test suite.

2006-01-29  Henning Makholm  <henning@makholm.net>

	* Update FSF address in GPL blurbs

	* Version 0.7.1
	* A few cosmetic changes done during debianization
	* The code now passes the testsuite on several Debian
	  architectures (powerpc, alpha, ia64, amd64, hppa,
	  sparc, mipsel, m68k). Unfortunately I lack the
	  access to test on non-Debian platforms.
