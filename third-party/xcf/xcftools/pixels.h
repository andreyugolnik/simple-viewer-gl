/* MACROS FOR INTERNAL PIXEL ORDERING HERE */
/*=========================================*/
/* In principle the internal representation of pixels may change.
 * - this was supposed to allow an optimization where a layer could
 * be represented as a pointer into the mmapped xcf file, if
 * alignment, bpp, and endianness agreed (the point was that the
 * pixel representation had to agree with the endianness).
 *
 * However, it turns out that the current Gimp _always_ saves images
 * with RLE encoding of tiles, so such an effort would be in vain.
 *
 * Just for modularity, nevertheless try to isolate knowledge of
 * the RGBA-to-machine-word packing in this section of the
 * header file. Define new macros if necessary.
 *
 * Given that we don't have to agree with the uncompressed
 * RLE format, we choose to have the alpha in the _least_
 * significant byte on all archs - it is tested and used more
 * often than the visible channels.
