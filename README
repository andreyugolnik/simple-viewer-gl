## Simple Viewer GL - simple and tiny image viewer based on OpenGL.##

The primary goal for writing sviewgl is to create an image viewer, which only has the most basic features required for fast image viewing. It has some vi-like key bindings and works nicely with tiling window managers (such as Ion3 and Notion).

***
**Features**

* Lightweight and fast: utilize hardware-accelerated video card;
* Very simple interface;
* Suitable for default image viewer of desktop;
* Minimal lib dependency: look library requirements below;
* Desktop independent: doesn't require any specific desktop environment;
* Open source, licensed under GNU GPL.

***
**Installation**

sviewgl is built using the commands (Linux):
```
$ make linux
```
or OS X:
```
$ make osx
```

**Default keybindings**

Key | Description
--|----
<esc> | exit
<space> | next image
<backspace> | previous image
<+> / <-> | scale image
<0> | set scale to 100%
<enter> | switch fullscreen / windowed mode
<ctrl>+<del> | delete image from disk
<s> | fit image to window (quick algorithm)
<v> | flip vertical
<c> | hide / show chequerboard
<i> | hide / show on screen info
<p> | hide / show pixel info
<b> | hide / show border around image
